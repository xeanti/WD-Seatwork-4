        <p>Kendrick Lamar is a proud father of two. <br>
           The “Humble” singer shares two children, a son and a daughter, with his fiancée, 
           Whitney Alford. Their first child, Uzi, 5, was born in July 2019, and the couple's second 
           child, Enoch, followed shortly after. Both Lamar and Alford — who’ve been together since 
           they were teenagers — are notoriously private about their personal lives.
            The pair have been engaged since 2015 but, aside from his song lyrics, the rapper rarely speaks about their relationship.</p>
